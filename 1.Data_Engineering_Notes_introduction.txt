Data Engineering

Everything around us produces data. A zoom call produces data on the participants logging activity, duration of meeting, recordings etc. 
Any source that produces data is a data source. 
The data collected from these sources can be stored in databases. However, with the increase in the amount of data and the type of data, we need a versatile source to store data. 
The centralised databased unit is a data warehouse. eg: Amazon Redshift, Google Bigquery



Big Data
Datasets with 5 V
1. Volume : Amount of data that is sent from data source to data warehouse.
2. Velocity : Rate at which data is getting added to data warehouse. 3 TB of data every month
3. Variety: Different types of data. Structured data, videos, audio etc
4. Veracity : Accuracy of the data. 
5. Value : Huge anounts of data is of no use unless we can get value of it.
